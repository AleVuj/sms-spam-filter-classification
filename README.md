# sms-spam-filter-classification
```
unfinished project
```
The dataset ('spam.csv') is a collection of 5,574 text messages in English.
Messages are labeled as ham (legitimate user text messages) and spam (unwanted messages)
The main idea is to transform the messages so that we could run some fancy algorithm on them.Some features which
we will try to use are: word count, bag of words, stemming , etc...
